# Up and Running
To begin using the SpellChecker app locally, fork and clone the frontend and backend (https://github.com/trevor-jameson/backend-spell-checker) repos. Open a terminal and cd into the frontend repo, then run **npm install && npm start**. This will direct to localhost:3000 by default. Then open another terminal and cd to the backend repo and run **bundle install** followed by **rails s -p 3001**.
